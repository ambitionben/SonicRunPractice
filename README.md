This project is a fan-made practice project created solely for educational and learning purposes. 
I do not own any legal rights to Sonic the Hedgehog or any related characters, assets, or intellectual property, which are owned by SEGA. 
This project is not intended for commercial use and is only a way for me to practice JavaScript game development and gain experience using Kaboom.js.
